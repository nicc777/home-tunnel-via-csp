# General notes

## Agent

This is the app that must be installed on each client that wishes to access the private host through the tunnel.

It will determine the NAT IP address (public IP address) of the client and push that to the cloud, where the IP address will be added to the firewall rules for access.

Additional IP addresses can be added to accommodate systems where the agent can not be installed, for example a mobile phone or tablet.

The files created in the cloud will have a limited life span (default 1 day) after which the files will be deleted. When the files are deleted, the firewall rules are deleted as well, via a Lambda trigger.
